_There have been some creative vibes in November 2020 which led to fiddling around with
[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/) and the Apple Pencil._ Post 1/2.

[As mentioned here]({{< ref "posts/second-post" >}} "Mentioned"), after a lifelong wait from April to November '20,
there's a new bike in town. I'm so in love that I started toying around with the iPad, Pencil & Affinity Designer which
led to the images below.

## Cinelli Logo

Hand crafted Logo as a puzzle piece for [Nemo's down tube]({{< ref "#cinelli-nemo-tig-gravel" >}}).
