[Following this post]({{< ref "posts/sixth-post" >}} "More terminal themes") I'm leaving the
[old configuration behind]({{< ref "posts/../third-post" >}}) for [something _Nord_ based](https://www.nordtheme.com).

## zsh prompt

<https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k>

This is faster than [spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt).

## vim color scheme

<https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim/>

From the [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com) ports.

## iTerm2 color scheme

<https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-iterm2/>

Also from the [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com) ports.
